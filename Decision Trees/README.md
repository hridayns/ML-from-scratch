# Features

Accuracy of **94.66%** obtained when Decision Trees classifier was trained on 1372 rows with 4 features each:

1. Variance of Wavelet Transformed image (continuous) 
2. Skewness of Wavelet Transformed image (continuous) 
3. Curtosis of Wavelet Transformed image (continuous) 
4. Entropy of image (continuous)

## Possible Classes

- Authentic (1)
- Fake (0)

## Files

1. *decTree .py* contains an implementation of Decision Trees based on classification error to predict authenticity of banknote from image wavelet features.

2. *decTree - google developers tutorial .py* contains code when following along with a Google Developers tutorial [here](https://github.com/random-forests/tutorials/blob/master/decision_tree.ipynb) to understand the concept of Decision Trees.
